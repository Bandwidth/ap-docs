# Conferences
The Conference resource allows you create conferences, add members to it, play audio, speak text, mute/unmute members, hold/unhold members and other things related to conferencing. Once a conference is created there is no timeout associated with it, i.e., the conference will stay in created state until it is explicitly terminated. After the last member of a conference is removed from it, the conference will be set automatically as completed.
