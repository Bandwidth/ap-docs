A common example is bridging an incoming phone call together with a outgoing phone call.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [`v1/calls`](calls/calls.md)                                            | The Calls resource lets you make phone calls and view information about previous inbound and outbound calls.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [`v1/conferences`](conferences/conferences.md)                          | The Conference resource allows you create conferences, add members to it, play audio, speak text, mute/unmute members, hold/unhold members and other things related to conferencing. Once a conference is created there is no timeout associated with it, i.e., the conference will stay in created state until it is explicitly terminated. After the last member of a conference is removed from it, the conference will be set automatically as completed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [`v1/domains`](domains/domains.md)                                      | A domain is a way to logically group endpoints. There is a 100 domain max. per account limit. Most use cases require using a single domain for all endpoints. The name of the domain will be part of a public DNS record. For that reason, we let the customer choose their domain names. Once a domain has been created, endpoints can be created and managed within the context of the domain. Because endpoints can only exist within the context of a domain, creating a domain is the first step in creating endpoints.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [`v1/endpoints`](endpoints/endpoints.md)                                | An endpoint represents is an entity that can register with the Application Platform SIP Registrar and place and receive calls. This can be a device like a phone or a pad, or it can be a softphone on a computer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [`v1/errors`](errors/errors.md)                                         | The Errors resource lets you see information about errors that happened in your API calls and during applications callbacks. This error information can be very helpful when you're debugging an application. Because error information can be large, and errors in the distant past are less useful than new ones, Bandwidth API limits the number of user errors it keeps.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [`v1/media`](media/media.md)                                            | The Media resource lets you upload your media files to Bandwidth API servers so they can be used in applications without requiring a separate hosting provider. You can upload files up to 65MB and file storage is free for an unlimited number of files. Files you upload can only be accessed by you when you supply your API access token and secret. They are not available to anonymous users. Bandwidth API supports the Cache-Control header when you upload files.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| [`v1/recordings/{id}/transcriptions`](transcriptions/transcriptions.md) | The Transcription resource lets you transcribe a voicemail recording. This resource can be either created automatically when the call property transcriptionEnabled is set to true, when call is created, or during the call by posting an event. The transcription is based on a call audio recording. By enabling/disabling call property recordingEnabled, a call can have more than one recording, so it's possible to have one or more transcriptions for each one of those recordings. When transcriptionEnabled is set to true all the recordings generated within that call are going to be transcribed, i.e, if you start to record a call, at any given time when the call is active, and then terminate the recording, the transcription resource will be automatically started for this recording; this process can happen many times. |
