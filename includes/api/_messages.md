## GET messages
Gets a list messages you have sent or received. Since this operation uses HTTP GET, all the properties are specified as HTTP request parameters.

Message results are paginated based on the `size` parameter. If the number of messages found by the specified query parameters exceeds one page, the `link` header on the HTTP response will contain the URL to request the next page of results. The `link` header will continue to be set for each request, as long as there is another page of messages available.

## POST messages
Sends one or more messages.

Sending a single message: To send a single text message, submit a single message representation as your request body. The response indicates the created message's URL in the Location header if it was created successfully. If there was an error with the message, the response body contains error information.

Sending multiple messages: To send multiple messages in a single request, submit an array of message representations as your request body. The response entity will contain an array of response objects, with the same length and order as the submitted message list, so you can iterate in the results to check for errors. Each result contains the URL of the of the message if it was created successfully or error information.

Important Note on Multiple Messages: There is a maximum limit of 50 messages sent per multiple messages request.

Important Note on Rate Limits: You can send 1 message per second per Bandwidth phone number.

International characters: Currently we support only the GSM 7 bit character set (GSM 03.38) .

<aside class="warning">
When sending MMS, the size of all medias for specific message summed up should not exceed 1.5 MB
