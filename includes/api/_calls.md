## GET calls/{callId}/transcriptions
Retrieve all transcriptions related to the call.

### Example: Retrieve all transcriptions related to the call.

```shell
curl -v -X GET https://api.catapult.inetwork.com/v1/users/{userId}/calls/{callId}/transcriptions \
	-u {token}:{secret} \
	-H "Content-type: application/json"
```

```js
// Promise
client.Call.getTranscriptions(callId).then(function (list) {});
// Callback
client.Call.getTranscriptions(callId, function (err, list) {});
```

```csharp
var transcriptions = client.Call.GetTranscriptions("{callId1}");
```

```ruby
transcriptions = call.get_transcriptions()
```


## POST calls/{callId}/gather
Collects a series of DTMF digits from a phone call with an optional prompt. This request returns immediately. When gather finishes, an event with the results will be posted to the callback URL.

### Example: Play a prompt sentence
Play a prompt sentence, then wait until 5 digits are pressed. Stop gathering digits if * is pressed, or if 7 seconds pass with no digits pressed.

```shell
curl -v -X POST https://api.catapult.inetwork.com/v1/users/{userId}/ \
	-u {token}:{secret} \
	-H "Content-type: application/json" \
		-d \
	'
	{
		"maxDigits":"5",
		"terminatingDigits":"*",
		"interDigitTimeout":"7",
		"prompt": {
			"sentence": "Please enter your 5 digit code"
		}
	}'
```

```js
//Create Gather
//The gather ends if either 0, #, or * is detected
var options = 	{
	"maxDigits":"5",
	"terminatingDigits":"*",
	"interDigitTimeout":"7",
	"prompt": {
		"sentence": "Please enter your 5 digit code"
	}
};
//Promise
client.Call.createGather("callId", options).then(function(res) {});

//Callback
client.Call.createGather("callId", options, function(err, res) {});
```

```csharp
var gather = await client.Call.CreateGatherAsync("{callId1}", new CreateGatherData {
	MaxDigits = "5",
	TerminatingDigits = "*",
	InterDigitTimeout = "7",
	Prompt = new GatherPrompt {
		Sentence = "Please enter your 5 digit code"
	}
});
```

```ruby
gather = call.create_gather({
	:max_digits => "5",
	:terminating_digits => "*",
	:inter_digit_timeout => "7",
	:prompt =>  {
		:sentence => "Please enter your 5 digit code"
	}
})
```


## GET calls/{callId}/gather/{gatherId}
Get the gather DTMF parameters and results.

```shell
curl -v -X GET https://api.catapult.inetwork.com/v1/users/{userId}/calls/{callId}/gather/{gatherId} \
	-u {token}:{secret} \
	-H "Content-type: application/json"
```

```js
client.Call.getGather("{callId}", "{gatherId}")
.then(function (res) {
  console.log(res);
});
```

```csharp
var gather = await client.Call.GetGatherAsync("{callId1}", "{gatherId1}");
```

```ruby
gather = call.get_gather("{gatherId1}")

## POST calls/{callId}/gather/{gatherId}
Update the gather.
<aside class="notice">
The only update allowed is state:completed to stop the gather.

### Example: Stop the gather DTMF

```shell
curl -v -X POST https://api.catapult.inetwork.com/v1/users/{userId}/calls/{callId}/gather/{gatherId} \
  -u {token}:{secret} \
	-H "Content-type: application/json" \
