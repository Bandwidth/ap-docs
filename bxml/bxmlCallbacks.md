## BXML Callbacks

###  Understanding BXML Callback Events
The events sent are the events from Bandwidth Application Platform, with only two exceptions:

* [transferComplete](callbacks/transferComplete.md): sent to the original BXML call when the transferred call hangs up
* [redirect](callbacks/redirect.md): sent when the verb redirect is in action

BXML callbacks perform HTTP GET requests to the **requestUrl** when the notification intends to retrieve a new BXML document.

BXML events are HTTP messages that are sent to your application server to notify you of activity related to your Bandwidth resources during a BXML usage.
