## XML: `<Record>`

The Record verb allows call recording. A call [recording](../callBacks/recording.md) event containing the recording URL is generated after the recording is stopped.

* If the `<Record>` verb is within a [`<Transfer>`](./transfer.md) verb, it is used to record both the caller and called party audio. The recording will stop only when one of the party disconnects.
* If the `<Record> `verb is outside a <Transfer> verb, only the called party audio is recorded. This is similar to situations where voicemail is recorded. `maxDuration` can be specified to stop recording after a specified period. Additionally, the caller can press a `terminatingDigit` to stop the recording. The recording will be in a single channel per file (mono recording).
